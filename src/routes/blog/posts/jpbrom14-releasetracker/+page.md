The first build of jpbROM14 was released on October 8, 2023, and since then it has received updates to both QPR1 (jpbROM14.1), and more recently, QPR2 (jpbROM14.2).

I was one of the first Android custom firmware developers to release their custom Android14-based firmware on October 8, however QPR builds of jpbROM14 have released slower.

The initial build of jpbROM14.1 released on March 30, 2024 (174 days after 14.0).

The initial build of jpbROM14.2 released on June 2, 2024 (64 days after 14.1 and 238 days after 14.0).

The initial build of jpbROM14.5 released on July 1, 2024 (29 days after 14.2, 93 days after 14.1, and 267 days after 14.0).

<h3>Update 5 - October 8, 2023</h3>
<p>jpbROM 14's port to Android 14 has been nearly finalised! It brings Android 14, which brings many improvements, like the Security & Privacy Center, new Easter Egg, new animations on lockscreen PIN entry and more, as well as the October 2023 security patch! However, Lineage-derived apps (Jelly browser and Aperture camera app, along with Gallery2 and ThemePicker) were not compiling or crashed, so they have been left out in this build...<br>However, the next build, coming next week, aims to rectify some of these issues as the Lineage repos synced from AOSP have just received Android 14 (LineageOS 21) code a few minues ago!! This makes me one of the first custom firmware devs to release their Android 14 firmware!<br>Enjoy the first Android 14 port of jpbROM 14!! ;D<br>Download the new build (V14.0.1.0.UDVMNMI) below:<br></p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oAaWPC8Qz4fgeV3cGI4LOXfEhQGfgpmn/view?usp=sharing">Download jpbROM 14.0.1.0.UDVMNMI emulator image</a>

<h3>Update 2 - June 17, 2023</h3>
