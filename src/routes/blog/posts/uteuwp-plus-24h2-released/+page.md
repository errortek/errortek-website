Yesterday, I completed UTE UWP Plus build 26100.1 and released it. Nothing very significant, right?


Well, actually, *yes* it **is** significant.


Let me explain to you why...

## The build number
This release is the **base build** of UTE UWP+ 24H2. The base build in this case is simply an initial build that a version of the app is based on. In this case, all later 24H2 builds will be based on 26100.1, and so will the Beta Channel builds 26120.xxxx.
## Why May 27 specifically?
Well, I chose to release all the Insider Previews at once on the same day to not have to make many separate releases afterwards and so that they are all grouped together under one release on the app's GitHub repository.
I originally chose May 24, because then they would be released exactly one month before 26100.1's public release, but that date passed without me compiling any of the builds, so I decided on a new date, May 27.


The actual reason I chose May 27 was just that I preferred the date over later in the month and that the release still had to be in May.


Now with that explained, let's get to the best part, the **FEATURES**!!
## Features
UTE UWP+ 24H2's base build, 26100.1, will be the first ever public stable release of UTE UWP+, so there are tons of new features to explore, with the most notable ones shown and explained below.
### Ribbon
The Ribbon has to be the largest and most impactful feature UTE UWP+ introduced, as well as the ability to switch between it and the existing TabbedCommandBar.
<br>
I created a slightly adjusted version of Ivirius Text Editor Free's Ribbon (thanks to Ivirius for making that ribbon!!), with more rounded corners, and even contributed some features back to the original, such as contextual tab styles.
<br>
Exciting, right?
<br>

### New Home Menu
The Home Menu is equally impactful, as it blends a beautiful backgroud with a structured user interface to create a new document using new Document Templates, as well as allowing the user to carry out common file operations, such as saving, opening, or deleting a file (file deletion not available in build 26100.1).

### Accent color customization
Another very impactful feature, especially important for those who value personalization, is the ability to change the accent color of the app to a different one than the accent color of the OS.
<br>
In build 26100.1 (actually, ever since build 26040.1000 😅), you can switch UTE's accent color between the default accent color of the OS, Slate Green, and Lilac.
More colors will be coming soon, as I feel like this is not enough yet, but it's ok for now, I hope!
